# codoforum-minecraft-server-status
A plugin for codoforum that displays the server ip, server status (online / offline) and the playercount on the server.
This plugin is still in WIP. It works OK but it might not work propperly on other codo versions. Feel free to test this on the latest version of codoforum and report the results to me. :)
This is also my very first plugin for codoforum!
